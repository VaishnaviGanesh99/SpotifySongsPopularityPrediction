# SpotifySongsPopularityPrediction
A project that explores the popularity of songs from spotify and predicts if a given song is popular or not and also gives the most important variables that are considered to give that prediction

Used the dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks
For simplicity, sampled from the original dataset and used that to run the models and explore, taking 5000 rwos from each year and made sure that the sample was representative of the original sample
